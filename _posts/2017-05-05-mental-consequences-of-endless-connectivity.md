The internet makes me feel as though I cannot disappear. Like I must always be on, standing at the ready, in tune and connected with the world.

But sometimes, we need to disconnect.

Disconnect from life, from work, from reality and the world around us.

It's healthy.

Humans need time in solitude.

Time to reflect.

We learn about ourselves and our world when we're out of touch and free to simply be.

Being always plugged in makes me feel as though I'm always being watched. And judged.

And sometimes I just want to escape.

To not protect myself and all the things I've done and I am and just let myself be wholly me, without even an ounce of feeling vulnerable or shameful.

Sometimes, I just want to be me.

Unabashedly me.
