Life is about the people you share experiences with and the memories you create throughout your journey.

Always go places, try new things, and seek out new experiences.

Routine and stability are good for part of life, but we learn and thrive when we mix things up a bit, get our of our elements, and let ourselves be free to explore and soak in all the world has to offer.

What we as individuals perceive to be normal is, in actuality, only “normal” for a few.

The rest of the world sees things differently and puts different emphases on the various elements of life.

Some prioritize social, some prioritize family, some travel, food, or career.

But at the end of the day, what truly fulfills you?

Go chase it.
