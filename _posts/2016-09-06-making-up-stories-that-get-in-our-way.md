Sometimes it can be hard to notice what’s right in front of us. To see things as they really are, and not as our biased brain wants us to perceive them.

Our brains make up stories by connecting data points and then filling in the blanks. Imagination runs rampant as we get caught up in the stories, convincing ourselves they are true and losing touch with any grounding in reality.

This kind of creativity can make for great inspiration when applied to art, theater, film, books and more, but in the real world, it may serve us to frequently check in with ourselves and look at things from a grounded place with a stable perspective so we can see things as they really are, and not as we falsely perceive them to be.

When you let go of the stories you typically tell yourself, you may end up finding that all the craziness you were preparing for, all the pain and suffering you thought you were heading towards, and all the anxiety you’ve been battling are really just products of your mind — and therefore can be overcome.

You may find that the thoughts running through your head are not entirely accurate, and that whatever situation you’re facing may not be as troubling as initially perceived.

And when you realize that your stories are not indicative of reality, you’ll then have a fresh perspective with which to act on — and a fresh perspective almost always opens up new possibilities.
