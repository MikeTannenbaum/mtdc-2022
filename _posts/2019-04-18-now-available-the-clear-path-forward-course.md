<p>If you could make improvements to the way your workday goes, what would you change?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Actually, where would you start?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More importantly, what's kept you from already making those changes?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I know, I know — time is of the essence and there's just not enough hours in the day, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You've got other things to work on and taking time to work on how you work just isn't really a priority right now. Right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems counterintuitive — silly, almost — to stop working so you can try something that might not work, given how much&nbsp;<em>actual</em>&nbsp;work you have to get done before your deadlines roll around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, I understand. Really I do. It's tough to slow down to speed up, and it's not the most intuitive behavior based on our societal cultures and values.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We value speed. We value growth. Productivity, efficiency, and most importantly, BUSY!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're not busy, you're not working hard enough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At least that's what the internet wants you to think!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I've got some news for you — busy is not the answer.&nbsp;<em>Busy</em>&nbsp;is the problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>"Do not confuse motion and progress."</strong></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They're entirely different, and one is way more important than the other. I'll let you figure out which one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So what are you to do in this world that values busyness when you know it's the wrong measurement for almost everything you do?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You change the system, that's what!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But how, you ask.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Honestly, I don't know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BUT— I&nbsp;<strong><em>do</em></strong>&nbsp;know that by bringing intention to the way you spend your time, and reflecting on what's working and what's not, and exploring new ways of doing things, you'll find yourself improving the way you function, behave, and work, which will lead to you reducing your busyness and increasing your effectiveness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And THAT,&nbsp;my friend—THAT, is a worthy goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Increasing your effectiveness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, you'll have higher levels of clarity, heightened levels of focus, and deeper insight and understanding of what you need to change to continually improve your surroundings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's for all these reasons and more that I'm proud and excited to unveil the initial version of the followup to my digital workbook: The Clear Path Forward Perspective-Shifting Course!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A mouthful, right? I know! It's cool. Let's dive in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Clear Path Forward Perspective-Shifting Course</strong>&nbsp;is designed to help you experience more joy, creativity, and meaning at work by guiding you to observe, adapt, and improve the way you do what you do.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's aimed at addressing everything we talked about above—and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a focus on breaking through barriers and addressing oft-ignored-yet-entirely-frustrating challenges, this course will rejuvenate your imagination, ignite your desire to make things better, and guide you through the process of getting started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The course is delivered via email on a weekly cadence and you have the ability to interact with me over email throughout your experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While this is v1 of the course, it is loaded with thought-provoking content, prompts to facilitate action, and a tested process that is sure to help you make things better throughout the duration of the course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Over 6-weeks you’ll receive a series of emails that will:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• Help you identify and understand where you want to focus your energy</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• Teach you effective ways to develop habits and shift behaviors</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• Guide you to envision and implement better ways of working</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>• Design a clear path forward to create meaningful improvements and progress with your work</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each week you’ll receive one email with ideas and exercises to help you think differently and shift your perspectives, along with actionable ways to put them into practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The course pairs nicely with the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://gumroad.com/miketannenbaum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Clear Path Forward Workbook</a></strong>, though it is entirely self-contained and effective on its own.
