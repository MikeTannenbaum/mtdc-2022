# aka Seeking professional climate action

I love this planet and I’d like to keep it around for a while—it’s the best I’ve had by far.

With no time to waste, I’m applying 15 years of operational, strategic, and organizational expertise to help teams **move from functional to optimal** as quickly as they can.

Ready to **level up your collaboration** and **work more effectively together** so we **heal the planet faster**? This page is for you.

# Hi! I’m Mike.

> **I help teams accelerate progress by working together more effectively**

I do this by designing and implementing new systems, services, and behaviors that build capacity, improve operations, and drive change.

As an experienced strategy and operations professional, my work guides people and teams to discover and implement better ways of approaching their challenges.

This often results in…

- Bringing clarity and organization to chaos
- Defining and aligning around shared visions
- Improving decision making processes and outcomes
- Identifying clear paths forward
- Making better use of modern technologies
- Improving holistic organizational effectiveness

Most recently, I led Organizational Effectiveness at [The Recycling Partnership](https://recyclingpartnership.org){:target="_blank"}, where I worked closely with the executive team to scope, design, and implement changes that led to more efficient communication, information flow, and collaboration across a high-performing distributed team.

Together, we improved our project and program management capabilities in three ways:

- By implementing systems, tools, and technologies to **improve accessibility of information**
- By implementing processes and workflows to **enable more efficient decision making**
- By teaching teams how to make **better use of digital tools and workflows** while discovering better ways of working together

## Now…

I’m looking for ways to support organizations directly addressing our climate crisis by helping them improve how people collaborate, teams operate, and impact is delivered.

### Areas I’d like to apply myself to:

*(A very non-exhaustive list)*

- Circular systems and economies
- Food systems and waste
- Nature and land conservation
- Renewable energy and climate-focused technology
- Regenerative farming and soil carbon sequestration

### Roles you might consider me for:

- Head of Operations (VP / Director / Lead)
- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief of Staff
- Team / Organizational Effectiveness
- Technology / IT Operations
- Program Director / Manager / Operations
- Corporate Strategy
