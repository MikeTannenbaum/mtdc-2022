Replay your own highlights.

You'll see yourself from a different perspective and will facilitate insight from which you can use to improve how you present to others.

Read the messages you send other people after you send them

Watch the videos you share with others after they see them

Imagine how you might come across to someone in a different situation.

Someone. Anyone.

Use what you notice as your guide to try something differently.

Change a behavior. Adjust your tone. Shift your energy.

Whatever it takes to try and meet someone where they are.

Life's full of compromises so you might as well learn how to make the best of em.
