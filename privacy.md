## Your privacy is respected here.

This site uses [Umami](https://umami.is/){:target="_blank"}, a privacy-first, open-source analytics platform. There are no cookies, no cross-site tracking, and no personal data collection. No consent banner needed because there's nothing invasive to consent to.

**What I can see (aggregated and anonymized):**
- Page views and visitor counts
- Referrer sources
- Browser, device, and OS types
- General location (country/region/city—derived from IP, which is never stored)
