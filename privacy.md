## The only thing tracked on this site are anonymized Visitors and Pageviews.

I use [Microanalytics.io](https://microanalytics.io/){:target="_blank"}, a lightweight and privacy-focused website analytics tool [powered by renewable energy](https://microanalytics.io/page/sustainability){:target="_blank"}.

When I look at the dashboard I am presented with the following information:
- Visitors
- Pageviews
- Pages (URL + Pageviews)
- Referrers
- Countries
- Browsers
- Operating Systems
- That's all!

Privacy is important to me but I also want to learn what notes and pages people are viewing, and where people are coming from. There are no Google-made [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters){:target="_blank"} tracking your entire behavior during your visit. It's just you and me and aggregated, anonymized data for me to glean insights here and there.

If you have questions about the site's performance, or my balance of privacy and data needs, please reach out anytime to [web@miketannenbaum.com](mailto:web@miketannenbaum.com).

Thanks for being here!
