# A Fresh Start to 2020
Moving my personal site back to Jekyll after years on Wordpress.

Time to simplify once again.

[https://mikeyt.xyz](https://mikeyt.xyz) is my quick landing page, but I need somewhere to host a decade's worth of online writing. I run [The Refined Mind](https://refinedmind.co), but that's a more focused niche site.

Enter, this repo.
